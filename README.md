# Microweaver - MicroPython Framework for ESP32 and Supported Microcontrollers

Microweaver is a lightweight MicroPython framework designed to simplify the development of applications for ESP32 and other supported microcontrollers. It serves as a scaffold or boilerplate to help embedded programmers get started with their projects quickly and efficiently. With Microweaver, you can focus on your application's logic instead of dealing with low-level hardware initialization and management.

## Features

- Abstraction for common hardware components and peripherals.
- Simplified initialization and configuration of hardware resources.
- Provides a foundation for building IoT and embedded projects.
- Designed to work with MicroPython and ESP32 out of the box.
- Extensible and customizable for different microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using Microweaver, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An ESP32 or a supported microcontroller.
- MicroPython installed on your device.
- A development environment set up for MicroPython programming.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the Microweaver repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nerdmonkey/microweaver-framework.git
   ```

2. Copy the `microweaver` directory into your MicroPython project directory.

3. In your MicroPython development environment, upload the `microweaver` directory to your microcontroller. You can use tools like `ampy`, `rshell`, or `uPyCraft` to upload files to your microcontroller.
